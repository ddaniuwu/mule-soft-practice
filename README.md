## Using ANypointStudio to build an API / Testing it with Postman
  - As first step we have to create a new project 
  - After this , we give a name to our project and we can see our workspace 
  - Using an HTTP procotol we select the option in the right section and take a listener to our main section.
  - Then we select a payload to set it in the project and get a new Endpoind & asign it to our flow.
  - To run the project we just have to right click in the API building and tap run project / stop project

## Testing with POSTMAN
