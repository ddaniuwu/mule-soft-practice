## Using ANypointStudio to build an API / Testing it with Postman
  - As first step we have to create a new project 
  - After this , we give a name to our project and we can see our workspace 
  - Using an HTTP procotol we select the option in the right section and take a listener to our main section.
  - Then we select a payload to set it in the project and get a new Endpoind & asign it to our flow.
  - To run the project we just have to right click in the API building and tap run project / stop project

## Working with maven and Anypoint Studio
- One of the main functions working with maven / ANypoint Studio is that , it will packaged 
- our Anypoint project and then will prepare it for a deploy with cloudHUB or onpremise 

-Firstly we have to install maven in our computer / verify the prerequisites are correct .
- Here we have some references that could help us to install maven (Ubuntu 20.04)
